# Welcome to the Blog

This is the first article on the site. Its primary purpose is to **stress-test** the styling and rendering logic of the application. Below you will find examples of standard Markdown syntax.

## Typography and Emphasis

You can emphasize text using **bold**, *italics*, or ***both***. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

## Code Highlighting

const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`;
};

console.log(greet("Developer"));
